Brittany helped me with the following code because I had no idea what it was asking for with the testing part or where to begin:

Test.assertEquals(formatWords(['ninja', 'samurai', 'ronin']),
 "ninja, samurai and ronin")
 
Test.assertEquals(formatWords(['ninja', '', 'ronin']), "ninja and ronin")
Test.assertEquals(formatWords([]), '')

The rest of it we worked on independently.  I helped her debug one thing but I didn't feel right using the code she had already finished, so I saved this part in notes.md and reworked the rest on my own.
