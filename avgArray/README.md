passed sample tests, gave error on submission.  i couldn't figure out what it was, but it was on the nullEmpty tests.  It wouldn't let me see what the test was, so I tried to implement a logic check for it but couldn't get rid of the error or figure out what I was doing wrong.  I left it in, but after unlocking the solution, the top one was exactly what I have here, but how I had it before I tried to add the logic check.  shrug.  stashing it for later.
